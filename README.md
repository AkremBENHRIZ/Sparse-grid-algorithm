# Sparse-grid-algorithm
For quantitative finance applications such as calibration and option pricing, numerical technique like interpolation methods could be applied [1]. The Tchebyshev technique has demonstrated a limited use in high dimensions. In order to address this problem, the Smolyak algorithm introduces an optimization algorithm that attempts to make the Tchebyshev method less complex and enable it to be applied to greater dimension problems than previously conceivable.
The Smolyak algorithm's Python code is explicited in this file.
